# fedi

The fediverse is made up of various servers running different backends, such as Mastodon, Pleroma and Misskey, which communicate to eachother over one protocol. This is all well and good, but many backends communicate to clients with different protocols, meaning most client apps only support a subset of backends.

fedi is a client designed from the ground up to easily support multiple backends within the same app.

Releases holds apks built every now and then, though for the latest build it may be better to build it yourself for now.
